# Creating a New Subdomain

This guide will walk you through the process of finding an available subdomain and proceeding to register it on the Devinit platform.

## Prerequisites

*   You must be logged into your Devinit account.
*   You should have an idea of the subdomain name you wish to register (e.g., `my-cool-site`, `blog`, `shop`). This will be combined with the main Devinit domain (e.g., `yourchoice.devinit.example.com`).

## Steps to Create a Subdomain

1.  **Navigate to the Subdomain Section**:
    *   If you already have domains, you can typically find the option to search for a new one on your **Profile Page**.
    *   If you don't have any domains yet, the Profile Page will prominently display a search input for a new subdomain.
    *   You might also find a search bar on the homepage or other relevant sections.

2.  **Enter Your Desired Subdomain Name**:
    *   In the input field labeled (for example) "your-desired-subdomain", type the name you want.
    *   **Validation Rules**:
        *   The subdomain must be at least **3 characters long**.
        *   Only **lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and hyphens (-)** are allowed. The input field will usually auto-correct or prevent invalid characters.

3.  **Check Availability**:
    *   As you type (after a short delay, typically 500ms), the system will automatically check if the subdomain is available.
    *   You will see a status message like:
        *   "Checking availability..."
        *   "Available!"
        *   "This subdomain is taken."
        *   "Subdomain must be at least 3 characters."

4.  **Proceed to Registration**:
    *   If the status is "Available!", a button (e.g., "Proceed to Checkout" or "Claim!") will become active.
    *   Click this button to go to the checkout page where you can finalize the registration of your chosen subdomain.
    *   If the subdomain is unavailable or your input is invalid, you'll need to try a different name or correct your input.

5.  **Complete Checkout**:
    *   Follow the instructions on the checkout page to select a duration for your subdomain registration and complete the payment (if applicable).

## Expected Outcome

Once you have successfully completed the checkout process:

*   The new subdomain will be associated with your account.
*   It will appear in the "Your Subdomains" list on your Profile Page.
*   Initially, the subdomain might have a status like "Active (Pending Verification)" or simply "Active" but without any DNS records pointing anywhere useful. The next step is to [configure its DNS records](./verifying-subdomain.mdx).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **"This subdomain is taken."**
    *   Someone else has already registered this subdomain. Please try a different name or a variation.

*   **"Subdomain must be at least 3 characters." / Input field doesn't accept certain characters.**
    *   Ensure your chosen name meets the length and character requirements (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only).

*   **"Could not check availability." / Error during availability check.**
    *   This might be a temporary system issue. Please try again after a few moments.
    *   If the problem persists, check your internet connection.
    *   If it continues, please contact [support](./../support/contact-us.mdx).

*   **Button to proceed is disabled.**
    *   Make sure the subdomain you entered is marked as "Available!" and meets all validation criteria.

After creating your subdomain, you'll need to configure its DNS records. Proceed to the [Configuring & Verifying Your Subdomain](./verifying-subdomain.mdx) guide.

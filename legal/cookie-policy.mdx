**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how [Your Company/Service Name] ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website [Your Website URL] (the "Service"), and your choices regarding cookies.

This Cookie Policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy, which sets out how and why we collect, store, use, and share personal information generally, as well as your rights in relation to your personal information and details of how to contact us and supervisory authorities if you have a complaint.

**Important Notice: This Cookie Policy is a template and should be reviewed and customized by a legal professional to accurately reflect your use of cookies and comply with all applicable laws (e.g., GDPR ePrivacy Directive, CCPA).**

## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device by websites that you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.

Cookies can also be "first-party" (set by us) or "third-party" (set by a domain other than ours, e.g., by our analytics or advertising partners).

## 2. How We Use Cookies

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):

### a. Essential Website Cookies (Strictly Necessary)

## 3. Your Choices Regarding Cookies

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies (other than strictly necessary cookies).

*   **Browser Settings:** Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. You can usually find these settings in the "options" or "preferences" menu of your browser. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org).

## 4. Other Tracking Technologies

In addition to cookies, we may use other similar tracking technologies like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.

In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

## 5. Changes to This Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.

Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.

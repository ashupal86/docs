# Connecting to AWS Amplify Hosting

AWS Amplify Hosting provides a Git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web apps with continuous deployment.

## Prerequisites

*   A registered domain name managed through our platform.
*   An AWS account and an app deployed with AWS Amplify Hosting.
*   Access to your domain's DNS settings on our platform.

## Step 1: Add a Custom Domain in AWS Amplify

<Steps>

### Open AWS Amplify Console
   Navigate to the AWS Amplify console and select your application.

### Go to Domain Management
   In the navigation pane, choose "Domain management."

### Add Domain
   Click "Add domain." Enter your root domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) and click "Configure domain."
   Amplify typically manages domains by having you add the root domain, and then you can configure subdomains from there.

### Configure Subdomains (and Root)
   Amplify will guide you through setting up your domain. You usually have options to:
   *   **Exclude the root domain** and only set up subdomains.
   *   **Redirect the root domain** to a subdomain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` to `www.yourdomain.com`).
   *   Configure specific subdomains (e.g., `www`, `app`).

   For each subdomain (and the root, if you're using it directly), Amplify will provide DNS records that you need to add to your DNS provider. This is often a CNAME record pointing to an Amplify-specific hostname (like `xxxxxx.cloudfront.net`) or sometimes A/AAAA records if using Amplify's domain management features more deeply.

   **Pay close attention to the CNAME Name and CNAME Value (or A/AAAA record details) provided by Amplify for each subdomain you configure.**

### SSL/TLS Certificate
   AWS Amplify automatically provisions an SSL/TLS certificate for your custom domain once it's successfully configured and DNS validation passes.

</Steps>

## Step 2: Add DNS Records on Our Platform

Based on the information from AWS Amplify after adding your custom domain:

<Steps>

### Log In and Navigate to DNS
   Access your dashboard on our platform and go to the DNS management section for your domain.

### Add CNAME Records (Most Common)
   For each subdomain (e.g., `www`, `app`) you configured in Amplify:
   *   **Type:** `CNAME`
   *   **Name/Host:** The subdomain itself (e.g., `www`).
   *   **Value/Target:** The CNAME target value provided by AWS Amplify (e.g., `d123abczyx.cloudfront.net`).
   *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

### Add A/AAAA Records (Less Common, if specified by Amplify)
   If Amplify provided A or AAAA records instead of a CNAME (this can happen in some configurations, especially if managing the domain more directly via Route 53 through Amplify):
   *   **Type:** `A` or `AAAA`
   *   **Name/Host:** Your subdomain.
   *   **Value/Target:** The IP address(es) provided by Amplify.
   *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

### Domain Verification Record (if required by Amplify)
   Amplify might also require a TXT or CNAME record for domain verification, especially for the root domain or during initial setup. Add this record as specified by Amplify.
    *   **Type:** `TXT` or `CNAME`
    *   **Name/Host:** As specified by Amplify (e.g., `_amplify` or a specific string).
    *   **Value/Target:** The verification value provided by Amplify.
    *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

### Save Changes
   Apply the new DNS record configurations.

</Steps>

## Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation and SSL Activation

<Steps>

### DNS Propagation
   Our platform uses a 10-minute (600 seconds) TTL. Allow 10-30 minutes for these changes to propagate globally. In some cases, it can take longer.

### Amplify Verification
   AWS Amplify will monitor the DNS changes. Once it verifies the records, it will proceed with SSL certificate provisioning and activating the domain.
   You can monitor the status in the AWS Amplify console under "Domain management." It will show stages like "Pending verification," "Pending deployment," "Available."

</Steps>

## Step 4: Test Your Subdomain

Once Amplify shows the domain as "Available," try accessing your subdomain (e.g., `https://www.yourdomain.com`) in a browser.

## Troubleshooting

<Steps>

### Double-Check DNS Record Values
   Ensure the CNAME (or A/AAAA) target values and names in our platform match *exactly* what AWS Amplify provided.

### Amplify Console Status
   The "Domain management" section in Amplify is your primary source of truth. It often provides error messages or status updates if something is wrong (e.g., "DNS records not found").

### Propagation Delays
   If it's been less than an hour, wait longer. Use a DNS propagation checker tool to see if your records are visible externally.

### Root Domain vs. Subdomain Configuration
   Amplify has specific ways of handling root domains (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) vs. subdomains (`www.yourdomain.com`). Ensure you followed Amplify's guidance for your desired setup.
   Often, for root domains, an ALIAS record (if supported by your DNS provider) pointing to the CloudFront distribution is preferred, but Amplify typically guides you through a CNAME-based setup for subdomains.

### Conflicting DNS Records
   Ensure there are no other A, AAAA, or CNAME records for the exact same subdomain that could conflict with the Amplify ones.

</Steps>

If issues persist, consult the AWS Amplify Hosting documentation or AWS support. When contacting our support, please provide:
*   Your domain name and the subdomain(s) in question.
*   Screenshots of the DNS records provided by AWS Amplify.
*   Screenshots of your DNS settings on our platform.
*   The status messages from the AWS Amplify console.

# Connecting Your Subdomain to Render

Render is a cloud platform for building and running applications and websites. You can easily connect your Devinit subdomain to services hosted on Render.

For the most accurate and detailed instructions, always refer to the [official Render documentation on custom domains](https://render.com/docs/custom-domains).

## Typical DNS Records Required by Render

Render typically uses **CNAME records** for custom subdomains pointing to your Render service's onrender.com address. They may also provide IP addresses for **A records** if needed, particularly for apex domains (though for your Devinit subdomains, CNAME is most common).

*   **For Web Services, Static Sites, etc. (Subdomains)**: Render will usually provide a target hostname like `your-service.onrender.com` for you to use in a **CNAME record**.

## General Steps

1.  **Add Your Custom Subdomain in Render**:
    *   Go to your Render dashboard and select the service (e.g., Web Service, Static Site) you want to connect.
    *   Navigate to the **Settings** tab for that service.
    *   Find the "Custom Domains" section and click "Add Custom Domain."
    *   Enter your full Devinit subdomain (e.g., `mysubdomain.devinit.example.com`) and click "Save" or "Add."

2.  **Identify Render's DNS Configuration**:
    *   After adding your subdomain, Render will display the DNS records you need to configure. 
    *   For a subdomain, this is typically a **CNAME record** with a **Target/Value** like `your-service-name.onrender.com`.
    *   Render will also usually perform a check and show the status of your domain verification.

3.  **Configure DNS Record in Devinit**:
    *   Log in to your Devinit account and go to your Profile Page.
    *   Find the subdomain you are connecting to Render.
    *   Set **Record Type** to `CNAME`.
    *   Set **Target Value** to the hostname provided by Render (e.g., `your-service-name.onrender.com`).
    *   Click "Save Configuration".

4.  **Verification in Render**:
    *   Return to your Render service's custom domain settings.
    *   Render will automatically check for the DNS record. Our DNS provider (Dynadot) applies a **10-minute TTL**, so the initial update from Devinit is fast. However, full global propagation for Render to verify can take from a few minutes to several hours (rarely up to 48 hours) depending on DNS caching worldwide. Patience is key during this period.
    *   Once Render verifies the DNS record, it will issue an SSL certificate, and your subdomain will be active and pointing to your Render service.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Render shows "DNS Not Configured" or similar**:
    *   Double-check that the CNAME record in Devinit points exactly to the `.onrender.com` address provided by Render.
    *   Ensure there are no typos.
    *   Allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (see point 4). Use an online DNS checker tool if needed.
*   **SSL Certificate Pending/Failed**: This usually resolves once DNS is correctly propagated and verified by Render. If it persists, re-check your DNS settings in Devinit.

# Connecting to Fly.io

Fly.io makes it easy to deploy applications globally. Connecting a custom subdomain involves pointing your DNS records to Fly.io's infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

*   A registered domain name managed through our platform.
*   A deployed application on Fly.io.
*   Access to your domain's DNS settings on our platform.
*   Fly CLI (`flyctl`) installed and authenticated.

## Step 1: Add Your Custom Domain to Your Fly.io App

Fly.io needs to know about your custom domain before it can serve traffic for it.

<Steps>

### List Your Apps
   Use `flyctl apps list` to find the name of your application if you're unsure.

### Add a Certificate for Your Domain
   Fly.io automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains. You first need to tell Fly which hostname you want to use.
   ```bash
   flyctl certs create your.subdomain.com
   ```
   Replace `your.subdomain.com` with the actual subdomain you want to use (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`).

### Note Fly.io DNS Configuration
   After running the command, `flyctl` will output the DNS records you need to set up. This usually includes:
   *   An **A record** pointing to Fly.io's Anycast IP address.
   *   A **AAAA record** pointing to Fly.io's Anycast IPv6 address.
   *   Sometimes, a **CNAME record** for `fly-verification` or similar, for domain verification.

   Alternatively, you can run `flyctl domains show your.subdomain.com` or `flyctl certs show your.subdomain.com` to get this information after adding the certificate.

</Steps>

Keep the output from these commands handy for the next step.

## Step 2: Add DNS Records on Our Platform

Now, configure the DNS records in your domain registrar's control panel (our platform).

<Steps>

### Log In and Navigate to DNS
   Access your dashboard and go to the DNS management section for your domain.

### Add the DNS Records Provided by Fly.io

*   **A Record:**
    *   **Type:** `A`
    *   **Name/Host:** Your subdomain (e.g., `app`, `www`).
    *   **Value/Target:** The IPv4 address provided by Fly.io.
    *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

*   **AAAA Record:**
    *   **Type:** `AAAA`
    *   **Name/Host:** Your subdomain (e.g., `app`, `www`).
    *   **Value/Target:** The IPv6 address provided by Fly.io.
    *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

*   **CNAME Record for Verification (if provided):**
    *   Fly.io might require a CNAME record for verification (e.g., `_fly._dnsauth.your.subdomain.com` or similar pattern like `fly-verification.your.subdomain.com`).
    *   **Type:** `CNAME`
    *   **Name/Host:** The full name provided by Fly.io (e.g., `_fly._dnsauth.app` if your subdomain is `app`).
    *   **Value/Target:** The target value provided by Fly.io.
    *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

### Save Changes
   Confirm and save your DNS configurations.

</Steps>

## Step 3: Verify Domain with Fly.io

Fly.io will automatically attempt to verify your domain ownership and issue an SSL certificate once the DNS records are correctly propagated.

<Steps>

### Check Verification Status
   You can check the status using `flyctl certs show your.subdomain.com`.
   Look for confirmation that the domain is verified and the certificate is issued. This might take a few minutes after DNS propagation.

</Steps>

## Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

Our platform sets a TTL of 10 minutes (600 seconds) for your DNS records. This means DNS servers worldwide are instructed to cache your records for 10 minutes before refreshing.

*   **Initial Propagation:** While our TTL is 10 minutes, allow 10-30 minutes for changes to become widely visible. Global propagation can sometimes take longer.
*   **Verification:** After waiting, try accessing `https://your.subdomain.com`. You can also use online DNS checker tools.

## Troubleshooting

<Steps>

### Double-Check DNS Records
   Ensure the A, AAAA, and any CNAME records match *exactly* what `flyctl` provided. Typos are critical.

### Fly.io Verification Status
   Run `flyctl certs show your.subdomain.com` again. It will often give clues if there's a mismatch or if it's still waiting for DNS.
   The command `flyctl doctor` can also sometimes help diagnose general issues with your app configuration.

### Propagation Delays
   If it's been less than an hour, DNS might still be propagating. Patience is key.

### Check Fly.io Logs
   Use `flyctl logs -a your-app-name` to see if your application is receiving traffic or if there are errors at the application level once DNS resolves.

</Steps>

If you encounter persistent issues:
*   Ensure `flyctl` is updated (`flyctl version update`).
*   Consult the Fly.io documentation and community forums.
*   When contacting our support, provide your domain, subdomain, the output of `flyctl certs show your.subdomain.com`, and screenshots of your DNS settings on our platform.

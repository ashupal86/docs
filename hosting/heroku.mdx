# Connecting to Heroku

Heroku is a popular Platform as a Service (PaaS) for deploying web applications. To use a custom subdomain with your Heroku app, you'll need to configure it in Heroku and then set up the appropriate DNS records.

## Prerequisites

*   A registered domain name managed through our platform.
*   A deployed application on Heroku (using at least a Hobby dyno for custom domains with SSL).
*   Access to your domain's DNS settings on our platform.
*   Heroku CLI installed and authenticated (`heroku login`).

## Step 1: Add Your Custom Domain to Your Heroku App

Heroku needs to associate your custom subdomain with your application.

<Steps>

### Identify Your Heroku App Name
   If you're unsure, use `heroku apps` to list your applications.

### Add the Custom Domain
   Use the Heroku CLI to add your custom subdomain:
   ```bash
   heroku domains:add your.subdomain.com --app your-heroku-app-name
   ```
   Replace `your.subdomain.com` with your desired subdomain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com`) and `your-heroku-app-name` with your app's name on Heroku.

### Note the DNS Target
   After adding the domain, Heroku will provide you with a DNS Target. This will be a hostname ending in `.herokudns.com` (e.g., `your-subdomain-com.herokudns.com` or `tokyo-1234.herokudns.com`).
   You can also view this information by running:
   ```bash
   heroku domains --app your-heroku-app-name
   ```
   Look for your custom domain in the list and note its corresponding "DNS Target".

</Steps>

This DNS Target is what you'll use for your CNAME record.

## Step 2: Add CNAME Record on Our Platform

Now, configure the CNAME record in your domain registrar's control panel (our platform).

<Steps>

### Log In and Navigate to DNS
   Access your dashboard and go to the DNS management section for your domain.

### Add the CNAME Record

*   **Type:** `CNAME`
*   **Name/Host:** Your subdomain (e.g., `www`, `app`). This is the part of `your.subdomain.com` before your main domain.
*   **Value/Target:** The DNS Target hostname provided by Heroku (e.g., `something.herokudns.com`).
*   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes) - this is the value our system uses.

### Save Changes
   Confirm and save your DNS configuration.

</Steps>

**Important Note:** Do not use an A record with Heroku. Heroku's infrastructure uses dynamic IP addresses, so you must use a CNAME record pointing to their stable DNS target.

## Step 3: Automatic SSL Certificate Provisioning

If your Heroku app is on a paid dyno type (Hobby, Standard, Performance), Heroku automatically provisions and manages SSL certificates for custom domains added via the `domains:add` command (Automated Certificate Management - ACM).

<Steps>

### Check SSL Status
   You can check the status of your SSL certificate in Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku certs:auto --app your-heroku-app-name
   ```
   It might take some time (from a few minutes to an hour) after the CNAME record propagates for Heroku to verify domain control and issue the certificate.

</Steps>

For apps on free dynos, custom domains are supported, but you'll need to use a third-party service like Cloudflare for SSL if HTTPS is required, as Heroku ACM is not available for free dynos.

## Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

Our platform sets a TTL of 10 minutes (600 seconds) for your DNS records. This advises DNS servers globally to cache your record for 10 minutes before checking for updates.

*   **Propagation Time:** While our TTL is 10 minutes, allow 10-60 minutes for the CNAME record to propagate widely and for Heroku to complete its verification and SSL provisioning.
*   **Verification:** Once propagated, try accessing `https://your.subdomain.com`. Use an online DNS checker to confirm the CNAME record is resolving to the Heroku DNS target.

## Troubleshooting

<Steps>

### Verify CNAME Record
   Ensure the CNAME record's "Name/Host" is just your subdomain (e.g., `www`) and the "Value/Target" is the exact `.herokudns.com` address Heroku provided.

### Heroku Domain Status
   Run `heroku domains --app your-heroku-app-name`. Check the status of your custom domain. It should not show any errors.

### Heroku SSL Status
   Run `heroku certs:auto --app your-heroku-app-name`. Look for `Status: OK`. If it says `Failing` or is stuck, there might be an issue with DNS propagation or the CNAME record.

### Propagation Delays
   DNS changes can take time. If you just made the changes, wait a bit longer.

### App Not Responding
   If DNS is resolving correctly but your app isn't loading, check your Heroku app logs:
   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail --app your-heroku-app-name
   ```

### Using Root Domains
   Heroku recommends using `www` or other subdomains. Pointing a root domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) directly to Heroku is more complex and often requires using a DNS provider that supports CNAME-like functionality at the root (like ALIAS, ANAME records, or CNAME flattening). Our platform might have specific ways to handle this if supported; otherwise, using `www` is simpler.

</Steps>

If issues persist, consult the Heroku Dev Center documentation. When contacting our support, please provide:
*   Your domain name and the subdomain in question.
*   Your Heroku app name.
*   The DNS Target provided by Heroku.
*   Screenshots of your DNS settings on our platform.
*   The output of `heroku domains --app your-heroku-app-name` and `heroku certs:auto --app your-heroku-app-name`.

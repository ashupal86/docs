# Connecting Your Subdomain to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. You can use your Devinit subdomain with your GitHub Pages site.

Always refer to the [official GitHub Pages documentation on custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for the most detailed and up-to-date information.

## Typical DNS Records Required by GitHub Pages

For a custom subdomain (like `mysubdomain.devinit.example.com`), GitHub Pages typically requires a **CNAME record**.

*   The CNAME record should point to your default GitHub Pages address, which is usually in the format `your-username.github.io` (for user/organization pages) or `your-username.github.io/repository-name` (for project pages, though you typically point the CNAME to just `your-username.github.io` and GitHub handles the repository part).

GitHub also provides specific IP addresses for A records, but these are primarily for apex domains. For subdomains, using a CNAME is generally the recommended approach.

## General Steps

1.  **Configure Custom Domain in GitHub Repository Settings**:
    *   Navigate to your GitHub repository that is configured for GitHub Pages.
    *   Go to the repository's **Settings** tab.
    *   In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    *   Under the "Custom domain" section, type your full Devinit subdomain (e.g., `mysubdomain.devinit.example.com`) into the field.
    *   Click **Save**.
    *   GitHub might create a `CNAME` file in the root of your repository with your custom subdomain in it. This is normal.

2.  **Identify GitHub Pages DNS Target**:
    *   The target for your CNAME record will be your default GitHub Pages domain, typically `your-username.github.io` or `your-organization.github.io`.

3.  **Configure DNS Record in Devinit**:
    *   Log in to your Devinit account and go to your Profile Page.
    *   Find the subdomain you are connecting to GitHub Pages.
    *   Set **Record Type** to `CNAME`.
    *   Set **Target Value** to your GitHub Pages default domain (e.g., `your-username.github.io`).
    *   Click "Save Configuration".

4.  **Verification and HTTPS**:
    *   Go back to your GitHub repository's **Settings > Pages** section.
    *   It might take some time for DNS changes to propagate and for GitHub to verify your custom domain. Our DNS provider (Dynadot) uses a **10-minute TTL**, meaning initial updates from Devinit are quick. However, global propagation for GitHub to fully verify can take from a few minutes to several hours (or longer in rare cases, up to 48 hours).
    *   Once verified, GitHub Pages will attempt to provision an SSL certificate for your custom subdomain to enable HTTPS. This process can take a little while.
    *   You should see a confirmation message like "Your site is published at [your custom subdomain]" once everything is set up.
    *   You can also often check the "Enforce HTTPS" option.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Domain not yet verified" / HTTPS Not Available**: 
    *   DNS propagation can take time (see point 4 for details). Wait up to 24-48 hours, though it's usually much faster.
    *   Double-check that your CNAME record in Devinit is correctly pointing to `your-username.github.io`.
    *   Ensure the custom domain name in your GitHub Pages settings exactly matches your Devinit subdomain.
    *   Make sure the `CNAME` file in your repository (if it exists) contains the correct custom subdomain.
*   **Page Not Found (404) after setup**: 
    *   Verify your GitHub Pages site is correctly building and deploying from the branch you've selected (e.g., `main`, `gh-pages`).
    *   Ensure your `index.html` (or other entry file) is at the root of the publishing source.

**Always consult the [official GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for the most comprehensive and current instructions.**

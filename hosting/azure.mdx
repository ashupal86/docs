# Connecting to Microsoft Azure

Connecting your custom subdomain to services on Microsoft Azure (e.g., App Service, Virtual Machines, Static Web Apps) requires updating your DNS records to point to your Azure resources.

## Prerequisites

*   A registered domain name managed through our platform.
*   An active Azure account with a deployed application or resource.
*   Access to your domain's DNS settings on our platform.

## Step 1: Get Your Azure Resource's IP Address or Hostname

This information depends on the Azure service you're using:

<Steps>

### For Azure App Service
   You'll typically use a CNAME record pointing to the default hostname of your App Service (e.g., `yourapp.azurewebsites.net`). You will also need to add the custom domain in the App Service's "Custom domains" section and Azure might provide a TXT record for verification (`asuid.yoursubdomain`).

### For Azure Virtual Machines
   You will use the public IP address of your Azure VM. Ensure your VM has a static public IP address for reliability.

### For Azure Static Web Apps
   Azure provides a default hostname. You'll add your custom domain in the "Custom domains" section of your Static Web App, and Azure will guide you through validation, often providing a CNAME or TXT record to add to your DNS.

### For Azure CDN
    You will use a CNAME record pointing to the CDN endpoint hostname (e.g., `yourcdnendpoint.azureedge.net`).

</Steps>

Consult the specific Azure service documentation for the precise IP address or hostname.

## Step 2: Add DNS Records on Our Platform

<Steps>

### Log in and Navigate to DNS
   Access your dashboard and go to the DNS management section for your domain.

### Add Necessary Records

*   **For an IP Address (A Record - e.g., Azure VM):**
    *   **Type:** `A`
    *   **Name/Host:** Your subdomain (e.g., `app`, `blog`).
    *   **Value/Target:** The public IP address of your Azure VM.
    *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

*   **For a Hostname (CNAME Record - e.g., App Service, Static Web Apps, CDN):**
    *   **Type:** `CNAME`
    *   **Name/Host:** Your subdomain (e.g., `www`, `store`).
    *   **Value/Target:** The Azure-provided hostname (e.g., `yourapp.azurewebsites.net`).
    *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

*   **For Domain Verification (TXT Record - often required by Azure):**
    *   Azure services like App Service or Static Web Apps might require a TXT record to verify domain ownership.
    *   **Type:** `TXT`
    *   **Name/Host:** Often `asuid.yoursubdomain` for App Service, or as specified by Azure for other services.
    *   **Value/Target:** The verification string provided by Azure.
    *   **TTL:** 600 seconds (10 minutes).

### Save Your Changes
   Apply the new DNS record configurations.

</Steps>

## Step 3: Configure Custom Domain in Azure Portal

For most Azure services, you must add and validate your custom domain within the Azure portal:

<Steps>

### Navigate to Your Azure Resource
   Go to your App Service, Static Web App, VM, etc., in the Azure portal.

### Add Custom Domain
   Look for a "Custom domains" or similar section.
   *   Add your full custom domain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`).
   *   Azure will perform a validation check. This is where the TXT or CNAME record (like `asuid`) you added previously comes into play.
   *   Once validated, you can often set up a binding, which might include SSL certificate management.

</Steps>

## Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

DNS changes rely on propagation. Our platform uses a 10-minute (600 seconds) TTL. This tells DNS servers globally to check for updates to your record every 10 minutes.

*   **Typical Timing:** While the TTL is 10 minutes, allow 10-30 minutes for changes to be widely visible. In some cases, it can take a few hours for full global propagation.
*   **Check Progress:** Use online DNS propagation checkers to see if your new records are resolving correctly from various locations.

## Step 5: Configure SSL/TLS Certificates in Azure

Secure your custom domain with SSL/TLS:

*   **Azure Managed Certificates:** Services like App Service and Static Web Apps offer free managed SSL certificates for your custom domains, which are automatically renewed.
*   **Bring Your Own Certificate:** You can also upload your own SSL certificates if you have specific requirements.

Ensure an HTTPS binding is created for your custom domain in Azure.

## Troubleshooting

<Steps>

### Verify DNS Record Values
   Mistakes in IP addresses or hostnames are common. Double-check them against the information from Azure.

### Check Azure Domain Validation
   Ensure the domain validation steps in the Azure portal for your specific service were completed successfully. Check if Azure is still waiting for a verification record (TXT or CNAME).

### Propagation Time
   If you recently made changes, wait a bit longer. Use a DNS checker.

### Azure Service Status
   Check the Azure status page for any ongoing issues with the service you're using.

### Firewall/Network Security Groups (NSGs)
   If using an Azure VM, ensure your NSGs allow inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).

### Browser Cache
   Clear your browser cache or try an incognito window to rule out local caching issues.

</Steps>

If problems persist, gather details like your domain, subdomain, the Azure service used, screenshots of your DNS setup on our platform, and relevant Azure configurations before contacting support.
